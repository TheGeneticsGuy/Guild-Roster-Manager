-- 1 ) Please avoid the "SYSTEM MESSAGES" as those are necessary for the addon code to properly identify and parse them. those are already complete.
-- 2 ) Any statement that "= true" needs to still be translated. Just remove the 'true' and replace it with the proper translation, in quotations 
--     Please include the {name} for where the player names should appear, as well as the few instances {num} needs to be included (referring to number)
-- 3 ) If appropriate, in the context of the sentence, please keep the spacing properly.
-- 4 ) Report any issues to Arkaan on CurseForge or Discord. -- You can also find me Battle.net @  DNADissector#1958   (US)
-- 5 ) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ADDING THIS TRANSLATION WORK!!! I will ensure you are mentioned in the release notes and at the top of this header for your contribution
