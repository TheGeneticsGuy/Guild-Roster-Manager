-- ALT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS IN A SINGLE CLASS
-- This will function to organize alt management easier and quicker access to the alt functions.
-- As GRM has grown, the core file has grown quite large. This will help me from trying to remember
-- if a function exists and trying to seek it out, to instead putting it in a more compact file.
